Objective of lab: To create a simple network to get used to using Cisco Packet Tracer and get an idea of how to 
configure simple networks.


Componants Used: 1 1841 Router, 1 2960-24TT Switches, 2 PC's


Steps: 

1: Layed out the basic network topology for the network and connected the devices
with a fast ethernet.

2: Configured the PC's with static IP addresses and set there default gateway to
192.168.1.1 so it would connect to the router after it was set up.

3: Used the CLI to configure the router, enable it and give it the IP of
192.168.1.1.


Results: Created a simple network and learned the basics of router configuration
and assigning IP addresses to establish connections.
