Objectives: Set up a basic DNS server to get my hands dirty with setting up 
both servers and DNS in cisco packet tracer.


Step 1: Set up the Network, used the same general network topology that I've been 
doing to get comfortable with Cisco Packet tracer. Star topology with a router, switch,
two computers and an addition of a Server.


Step 2: Set up the server, this involved creating DNS records and enabling HTTP so I could
load an actual webpage. Then I mapped the DNS server to the PC's so they could access it.

	A records: example.com
	Server IP: 192.168.1.100


Step 3: Load the webpage to verify that everything is setup correctly.
