Objective: This lab I want to now expand on what I learned and did in the last lab and make VLAN's
	   that I can route traffic from one VLAN to another VLAN. Will need to use a layer 3 switch
	   for this and figure out how to break up these two ip address segements. 

Resources: Starting at page 407 of Mike Meyer N08 book is the section on Inter-VLAN Routing


Step 1: Setup router as a default gateway.
