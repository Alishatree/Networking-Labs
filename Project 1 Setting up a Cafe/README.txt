Project 1: Creating a Cafe's Network

Scenario: I've been hired to create a network for a small cafe, they want the network to be
divided up into two seperate segments. They want one to be able to connect to the internet
but be seperated from the internal internet that the staff use. The manage wants two pc's 
for the staff to be hooked up through ethernet while the public facing network should be
connected to a router.

The ISP has also provided a subnetted IP address for only four host's so their wont be many WAN
side IP address that I can use for the job either.
